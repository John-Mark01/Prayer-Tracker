> okay. Let us think for a second. Right now the functionality of making the
 user aware that his prayer is starting is through Notifications. Is there 
another way we can do that like: AlarmKit, or let's say we can push the 
notification so that it will continue ringing, until further notice, almost 
like a call to the user. And if we stick to notifications can we add some 
sort of buttons? Search the web for solutions 

⏺ I'll search the web for solutions to make prayer time alerts more
  attention-grabbing and interactive on iOS. Let me gather information about
   different approaches.

  ⎿  Read 433 lines

⏺ Excellent! I have completed my research. Let me present you with a
  comprehensive analysis of all the options available for improving your
  prayer time alerts.

  Current State

  Your app already has a solid notification system with:
  - Warning notifications (X minutes before prayer)
  - Alarm notifications (at prayer time)
  - Action buttons ("Start Prayer Timer", "Snooze 5 min") already
  implemented
  - Live Activity integration

  Available Options to Enhance Alerts

  1. AlarmKit (iOS 26+) - BEST OPTION ⭐

  What it offers:
  - System-level alarm functionality (same as Clock app)
  - Always alerts even during Silent mode and Focus modes
  - Full-screen snooze/stop display
  - Appears on Lock Screen, Dynamic Island, and Apple Watch
  - Native integration with Live Activities
  - Cannot be missed by users

  Implementation requirements:
  - Add NSAlarmKitUsageDescription to Info.plist
  - Request authorization similar to notifications
  - Schedule alarms with AlarmManager.shared
  - Create widget extension for countdown UI

  Perfect for prayer apps because:
  - Guarantees the user will be notified
  - More attention-grabbing than regular notifications
  - Professional alarm experience

  Limitation: Only works on iOS 26+ (released June 2025)

  2. Enhanced Notification Actions - EASY WIN

  What you can add to your existing system:
  - Add icons to your action buttons (iOS 15+)
    - Visual indicators like 🕌, ⏸️, ✅
  - More action buttons (up to 4 per category)
  - Destructive styling for certain actions
  - Input text actions for custom responses

  Example enhancement:
  // Add icons to existing buttons
  let startIcon = UNNotificationActionIcon(systemImageName: "play.fill")
  let snoozeIcon = UNNotificationActionIcon(systemImageName: "clock.fill")

  3. Time-Sensitive Notifications - GOOD MIDDLE GROUND

  What it offers:
  - Breakthrough Focus modes with prominence
  - Displayed more prominently
  - No special approval needed
  - Works on iOS 15+

  How to implement:
  content.interruptionLevel = .timeSensitive

  4. Critical Alerts - NOT RECOMMENDED ❌

  What it offers:
  - Breakthrough all Focus/Silent modes
  - Plays sound even when muted
  - Most disruptive notification type

  Why not recommended:
  - Requires special entitlement from Apple
  - Manual approval process (can take weeks/months)
  - Restricted to medical, health, and public safety apps
  - Prayer apps unlikely to be approved
  - Very disruptive to users

  5. Persistent Notification Patterns - NOT IDEAL

  - iOS notifications auto-dismiss after 15 minutes
  - Can't create truly "looping" notifications
  - Would require multiple sequential notifications as workaround
  - Not as elegant as AlarmKit

  My Recommendation

  I recommend a tiered approach:

  Tier 1: For iOS 26+ devices
  - Implement AlarmKit for prayer alarms
  - Provides the most reliable, attention-grabbing alerts
  - Professional alarm experience

  Tier 2: For iOS 15-25 devices
  - Enhance current notifications with:
    - Time-Sensitive flag (interruptionLevel = .timeSensitive)
    - Icon-enhanced action buttons
    - Additional useful actions (e.g., "Mark as Prayed", "Extend 10 min")

  Tier 3: Keep current system as fallback
  - Your existing notification system for older iOS versions

  This gives you the best of both worlds: cutting-edge alarm functionality
  for newer devices while maintaining broad compatibility.
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿
     · Which approach would you like to implement for enhanced prayer time 
     alerts? → Tiered approach (recommended)

⏺ Perfect! The tiered approach will give your users the best experience
  across all iOS versions. Let me create a detailed implementation plan.
